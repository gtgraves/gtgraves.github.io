title: My Bloc Experience So Far

---

One of the reasons it took me so long to commit to an online program like Bloc was not knowing what to expect. It's not cheap! And it's natural to want to know what you are committing to before putting down that kind of money. I found a lot of helpful posts from other bloggers out there describing their experiences with Bloc, which helped me realize that it was the right program for me. So this post is my attempt to pay that forward with a brief summary of my experience with Bloc so far.

One thing that I should note right up front is that Bloc's curriculum is continually changing. They are constantly removing old parts of their courses and updating them with new ones. During my time with the program they have overhauled their career services lessons as well as some of their backend fundamentals checkpoints. So my experiences may be entirely different than what someone starting today would find.

### Three Phases

My Bloc Web Developer track was divided into three phases (Bloc calls them "modules" and actually considers there to be four, but realistically the first two modules cover the same general topics).  The first phase introduces Frontend development and deals with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The second phase introduces Backend development and teaches basic Ruby as well as Ruby on Rails.  The final phase is a "Specialization" section, where you are able to choose from a variety of projects based on what interests you or work on a capstone project of your own. As of the time of this post, I am just about to being work on the final module.

Each phase can be divided into a number of segments.

### Fundamentals

Each phase begins with teaching some basic fundamentals of the area you about to focus on. In the frontend portion of the course, this covers basic HTML and CSS concepts, learning how to utilize the command line in your development setup, and introducing the basic concepts of Git and GitHub. It then moved on to a series of introductory lessons about programming in JavaScript. The backend fundamentals section focuses entirely on basic Ruby.

When I began Bloc, most of these fundamentals sections involved outside resources, such as [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) courses or [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) segments. Some of these were super helpful (I found Code School's JavaScript Roadtrip course to be very helpful in introducing the basic concepts of JavaScript) though had the downside of not being very practical. You would learn about programming concepts without really knowing how to apply the concepts practically in a real-life app. This was especially the case with the introductory Git courses, as I really didn't feel like I knew how to use Git until I was building apps and pushing commitments to GitHub for my mentor to review. Some of the courses were incredibly confusion and not very helpful (the Ruby course from Code School, for example). Fortunately, when I was about half-way through the Ruby fundamentals section, Bloc overhauled it with their own lessons that they had designed, which were much more instructive.

### Foundations

Up next in each phase is the Foundations section, which primarily consists of 20-30 checkpoints in which you create a project while learning the fundamentals of a particular language. In the checkpoint portion of each lesson, you learn some new concepts while implementing new code into your project. Each checkpoint is completed with an assignment in which you add additional features to your app with little to no guidance other than documentation. It's a little intimidating at first, but once I understood the fundamentals, most assignments were easy to complete (typically, if I was having major issues, it was because I had completely forgotten about a concept taught earlier in the checkpoint, or I had some minor bugs in my code).

These checkpoints are interspersed with quizzes (consisting of 10-12 multiple choice questions).  They can be tricky but I always ended up doing better than I expected I would. There are also programming reinforcement checkpoints that have you complete certain Katas on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com), which help remind you of some of the fundamentals taught in the previous section.

The bulk of your learning in Bloc is in these Foundations sections, and by the time you complete each one, you have a solid understanding of either JavaScript or Rails.

### Projects

After you complete the Foundations section, you are presented with a series of projects to complete, which take the concepts you learned in the Foundations section and expands upon them. Unlike the Foundations section, however, you are given little more than a case study (e.g., "As a user, I should be able to log into the app") along with a brief introduction of any new helpers or gems that will need to use to solve the problem.  For example, in one of the Rails projects, a checkpoint asks you to allow users to sign up for an account in your app, points you to the [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) Gem and some related resources, then leaves you to figure out how to solve the problem.

These projects are incredibly intimidating at first, especially when you are starting from scratch.  But by the time I got 2-3 checkpoints in, I got the hang of reading documentation, implementing new modules and/or controllers, and completing the task at hand. And if you ever get stuck, your mentor is just an email away.

### Assessments

Throughout the course, you are occasionally not allowed to proceed further until you complete an assessment. An assessment is a live "test" taken in front of a Bloc evaluator (over Google Hangouts) and it is meant to simulate a technical interview that you may experience during the job search.

I generally found these to be pretty intimidating until you sat down to do them.  The evaluators are super nice and will always give you feedback at end if you got any questions wrong. You are not expected to do perfectly, and are given opportunities to retake the assessments if you fail (which I thankfully have not had to do so far).

That's the day-to-day life of a Bloc student! Hopefully it is helpful to those interested in signing up.
