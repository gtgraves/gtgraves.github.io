title: Why I Chose Bloc
---
It was probably late 2015 (sometime around the holidays) when I started seriously contemplating learning how to code and using those skills to facilitate a possible career change. However, it took me another year or so to find a coding program and actually start moving towards my goal. I could give plenty of reasons as to why it took so long.  I was nervous about my job prospects if I did commit to coding, my current work was keeping me busy enough without adding what amounted to another part time job on top of it, and, quite frankly, it's hard to give up that little bit of free time that I had! But I think the main obstacle in my way was figuring out how to efficiently learn how to code while creating the best job prospects for myself.

I weighed several options before landing on [Bloc](http://www.bloc.io), an online bootcamp that has both a part-time web developer track (which I took) and a more full-time software developer track.  There are numerous reasons why this ended up being the right fit for me (and, a year in, I still think it was the correct choice).  But it's easier to explain why the other options I explored were not the best fit. Here are some of the options I considered but ultimately chose not to pursue.

### Self Study: Complete Flexibility; No Structure

The first option I came up with was to just teach myself.  I could just grab some books from Amazon, work my way through them on my own pace, and come out knowing a lot more than I did at the beginning.  This would probably be the cheapest method (minus the cost of books), and I could dictate my own pace, meaning that I would not need to worry about work getting in the way. Given that I have generally been relatively self-sufficient, especially when it comes to computers and the little bit of HTML/CSS that I had picked up over the years, I should be able to teach myself plenty.

But I quickly realized that this option would likely not work, or, rather, that I would never achieve my goal this way. First, there was the issue of motivation, or lack thereof.  Self study would give me the flexibility to go at my own pace, but that would come with the downside of not having anything or anybody holding my feet to the fire.  Don't feel like coding today? No worries, because there are no consequences. I remembered how, back in high school, I had bought myself a big book on HTML with the plan on working my way through it, only to let it sit gathering dust on my bookshelf after the first few week. I was concerned that the same would happen here.

Furthermore, I didn't know where to begin! Google "what coding language should I start with" and you're going to get multiple blog posts arguing different opinions while the comments below devolve into fights about what language is better. I also couldn't figure out where to "end"! While I knew that my education would be ongoing, I realized that the self study route could lead me to a situation where I might have taught myself a lot but had nothing to show for it, like no projects for a portfolio. In fact, I wasn't even sure what should end up in a portfolio! Self study would give me the flexibility I needed, but not the structure and goal posts that would keep me going.

### Online Courses: More Structure; No Accountability

My next thought, and one I actually attempted, was to take a free online coding course. I had heard great things about [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and it seemed to offer some of the incentives that were lacking in pure self study.  They had a series of curated courses that I could work my way through, and would suggest what languages to start with based on my goals.

I actually started working on Codecademy's HTML and CSS lessons in my spare time, but quickly found that, much like offline self study, I was facing an accountability issue.  I would have weekends where I would blow through a handful of lessons and be proud of myself, only to completely drop off for weeks when I decided I "needed a break" from the hustle of my everyday life. After several months, I realized that it would take me way too long to get to my goal of knowing enough code to change careers through this method, and that I needed to recalibrate.

### Bootcamps: The Nuclear Option

It was at this time that I started seriously considering a coding bootcamp in my area.  I had frequently read about bootcamps in my research - the fabled 10 to 12-week immersive courses that would teach you everything you needed to know to get a job in software development. But while I was concerned that such camps would only be found in "tech heavy" areas such as California and, closer to home, Austin, as I started researching them more closely, I was surprised to find that there were a lot camps like this in Dallas.  [Coding Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.com/dallas), [DevMountain](https://devmountain.com/dallas-bootcamp), and The (now closed) Iron Yard all offered multi-week programs in frontend and backend web development without me having to leave town.

As interesting as these programs were, I just could not bring myself to pull the trigger. These bootcamps are typically structured as full-time, highly immersive programs. They are all-day (9-5) courses, meaning I would have to quit my job to take them. While I certainly understand that, for some people, that's an acceptable commitment, I knew that was something I could not do. I'm incredibly fortunate that I already have a job that pays well and supports me and my wife with little issue.  And while I was prepared to start from the bottom again with this new career change, losing my salary for several months to take a bootcamp just wasn't an option.  And while some of these bootcamps offered part-time evening or online options, my work schedule is erratic enough (sometimes requiring me to drop my evening plans and work late into the night) that I was afraid to commit to a course that would require me to always be available on select nights and weekends. I'm sure in-person bootcamps are a great choice for a lot of people, but I did not think I could make it work.

### Bloc and the Online Bootcamp: The Best of All Worlds

In my research on in-person bootcamps, I learned about online programs like Bloc and [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com).  These offered all the benefits of an in-person bootcamp (a structured curriculum based on what skills employers were looking for) with the flexibility that my job required. I eventually settled on Bloc for multiple reasons.

**A variety of courses:** Bloc offered two separate course tracks: a web development track and a more in-depth software development track, both of which were structure around the skills that were currently in-demand (there is also a designer track but I knew I lacked the artistic chops for that path). The software development track was particularly interesting to me, but due to concerns about the time commitment (it would take over 2 years to complete at the pace I knew I would be able to handle, and I was wanting to change careers before then!) I ended up going with the web development program.

**The most flexible time commitments:** Probably my biggest concern about committing to a bootcamp (whether in-person or online) was that I was going to commit to dozens of hours a week only to find out that my job would get in the way.  All of Bloc's programs offered several tiers of commitment, ranging from as little as 12 hours a week to as many as 40. They also noted that I could start at a lower hourly commitment (I started at the bottom) but could increase my pace if my schedule permitted it.  Generally, the 12-15 hour per week commitment ended up being perfect for me.

**Structure and Mentorship:** Bloc is focused on working your way through various checkpoints and assignments at your own pace while checking in with your mentor for weekly meetings (or more frequently if you are on a more accelerated pace than I am). The curriculum isn't perfect (there have been some instances that it asks you to apply new skills or tools without giving you anything more than the base documentation, which can be terrifying at times), but my mentor has always helped me through those issues and I feel that I have learned an incredible amount. Plus, the weekly meetings keep me accountable and motivated to keeping moving forward and working on projects over the weekend even if there is something else I'd rather be doing.

Obviously, there is no right program for everyone, but Bloc ended up being the perfect fit for me. The right amount of flexibility with enough structure and accountability to allow me to retain and utilize the skills I've learned.
